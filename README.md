Final Project: Part 1 - GitHub UI Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Calculation Formula

The simple interest is calculated using the following formula:

Where:
- **p**: principal amount (the initial amount)
- **t**: time period in years
- **r**: annual rate of interest (in decimal form)

## Usage

### Input:
1. **p**: Principal amount
2. **t**: Time period in years
3. **r**: Annual rate of interest (as a percentage)

### Output:
- Calculated simple interest amount

## Example Calculation

For example, if you input:
- Principal (p) = \$1000
- Time (t) = 5 years
- Rate (r) = 3% (0.03 in decimal)

The calculation would be:
simple interest = 1000 × 5 × 0.03 = $150
